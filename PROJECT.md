# Prime Void: Next-Generation JavaScript HTTP Client

## Vision
Prime Void aims to be a next-generation HTTP client for JavaScript that surpasses existing solutions like Axios by focusing on performance, security, reliability, and developer experience. Our goal is to create a more powerful, consistent, and feature-rich HTTP client that meets modern web development demands.
